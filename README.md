### Target Variable

The target variable for this regression analysis is not explicitly mentioned. Please specify the target variable in the context of the analysis.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loading the dataset
   - Data cleaning (handling missing values, data types)
   - Feature selection (if necessary)
   
2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Summary statistics
   - Data visualization (scatter plots, histograms, etc.)
   
3. **Polynomial Regression:**
   - Model selection (degree of polynomial)
   - Model training
   - Model evaluation using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and ABS (Absolute Error) on both train and test datasets
   - Visualization of model predictions
   
4. **Model Coefficients:**
   - Display the coefficients of the best model
   
5. **Model Hyperparameters:**
   - Display the chosen hyperparameters (e.g., alpha in case of regularization)
   
6. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize the findings
   - Discuss the performance of the polynomial regression model
   
7. **Data Transformation (if applicable):**
   - Feature scaling or transformation techniques used
   
8. **Additional Insights (if applicable):**
   - Any additional analysis or insights gained from the data

## Results

Here are the results of the polynomial regression analysis:

- The best model was found to be of degree 4.
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) on the test dataset: 17.14
