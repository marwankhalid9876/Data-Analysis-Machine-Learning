# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains code and analysis for three different machine learning and data analysis projects. Each project explores a different dataset and applies various techniques and algorithms to make predictions or gain insights.

## Polynomial Regression Notebook

**Description**: This notebook focuses on building a polynomial regression model to predict a specific target variable based on air quality measurements and weather data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, evaluation, and visualization.

**Results**:
- The best model has a polynomial degree of 4.
- RMSE on the test dataset: 17.14
- RMSE on the training dataset: 14.90
- Absolute Error on the test dataset: 11.38
- Absolute Error on the training dataset: 10.40

## Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM README

**Description**: This repository explores three different datasets and applies various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict outcomes in different scenarios. The datasets cover predicting cancer presence, income levels, and heart disease presence.

**Results**:
- Each dataset is analyzed individually, and the best-performing models are highlighted.
- Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used for model evaluation.

## K-Means Clustering

**Description**: This repository contains code and documentation for a K-means clustering assignment on a dataset of images. The project involves reading and processing data, performing K-means clustering, evaluating the results, and visualizing the outcomes.

**Results**:
- The K-means clustering process is repeated 10 times to find the best clustering result based on the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI).
- Predictions are made on the test data, and a confusion matrix is generated to evaluate performance.

Feel free to explore each notebook or section for detailed code, analysis, and results related to each project.
