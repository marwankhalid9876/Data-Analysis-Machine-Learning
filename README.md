Polynomial Regression Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook presents a detailed analysis of a polynomial regression model applied to a dataset. The dataset contains air quality measurements and weather data, and the goal of this analysis is to build a polynomial regression model to predict a specific target variable based on the given features.
